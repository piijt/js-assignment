        <p>
            Write an HTML page with at least three div, or p elements in the body. A few lines of text in each. You may use http://lipsum.com/.
        </p>
        <div>
            Write some JavaScript such that when the user hovers over an element it's style is changed so that it will display a red outline with a 2px line. When the mouse is moved away, the outline must disappear.
        </div>
        <p>
            Hint: You may want to research the mouseover, and mouseout events.
        </p>
        <div>
            Hint for beginners: You may prefer to work with embedded JavaScript
            while you test your code. Once it works as desired, separate the
            JavaScript into an individual .js file, test again, then hand
            in your solution.
